# Description
The theme for this application is Countries Around the World. The page is meant to display a predefined set of country buttons that, when clicked, populate a limit of up to 10 g-rated gifs of that country. The gifs will default to its still display, but when a gif is clicked, will change to its animated display. Every time a new button is clicked afterwards, the previous set of gifs are erased and the new ones of the next button are displayed. 

# Languages Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, Giphy API

# Composition
Buttons of countries, form for adding more buttons, display area for the gifs. 

# Takeaways
This assignment could not have been done without all the supplemental class activities and pair codings that went into solving them. I do feel that I have somewhat of a better understanding of the APIs and how to integrate the code (but maybe I just feel good about Giphy's API, idk about the millions of others). Surprisingly this assignment took a while to complete for something that drew directly from previous class activities, but overall am happy to have merged the logic all together. ONE BIG THING was this crazy bug I had that I found out came from the fact that I had given both my buttons and gifs the same class, so on click of the loaded gif, it would return an undefined object. It was super freaky but really incredible to have figuered out (after about 2 hours haha).

# Feedback
This assignment definitely took a backseat on the CSS styling. Even with all the code that was pulled from the class activities, I still feel that I don't completely understand what's happening with it on my own. Basically, I wouldn't have been able to finish this assignment without having all the steps pre-thought out for me. Would love to get some tips on essential takeaways from this assignment since I'm not entirely sure what to hone in on.
